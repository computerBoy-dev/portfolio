## ⚡ Overview

This is not just a static website; it is **AARYAN_OS**. 

Designed with an **"Industrial Minimalist"** philosophy, this portfolio mimics a high-performance terminal interface. It bridges the gap between abstract code and visual design, featuring a **real-time AI Agent** that answers questions about my projects, skills, and architecture.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🤖 1. Self-Aware AI Agent (AARYAN_OS)
* **Powered by Groq & Llama 3:** An embedded terminal chat that knows everything about me.
* **Context-Aware:** It can explain how my projects (Pratyaksha, CodeGap) work in technical detail.
* **Strict Persona:** It refuses to answer general queries (e.g., jokes/weather) and stays strictly professional.

### 📱 2. Fluid Responsiveness
* **Mobile-First Engineering:** Uses `clamp()` based fluid typography. Text scales seamlessly from iPhone SE to 4K Ultrawide monitors.
* **Adaptive Layouts:** The grid system transforms from a single-column stack on mobile to a multi-column command center on desktop.

### 🎨 3. Industrial Aesthetics
* **CRT Scanline Effect:** A subtle overlay giving a raw, engineering feel.
* **Glassmorphism Cards:** Sharp-edged, frosted glass UI elements.
* **Live Status Terminal:** A dynamic widget showing location, status, and role.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** HTML5, Tailwind CSS (CDN)
* **Scripting:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
* **AI Backend:** Groq Cloud API (Llama 3-8b-8192)

### Changing Projects
Locate the `<section id="projects">` in `index.html`. Each project is a `div` with the class `group`. You can copy-paste the block to add more projects.

### Modifying AI Knowledge

```javascript
const SYSTEM_PROMPT = `
You are [YOUR_NAME]_OS.
KNOWLEDGE BASE:
- PROJECT 1: [Your Project Name] - [Description]
